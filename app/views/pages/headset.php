The body of the gadget is fitted with everything you need to use it without extra accessories (long-lasting battery, an indicator of battery level, volume button, USB type C, sim card slots, forehead, rear-head and nose pads, cameras, speaker, and microphone</p>

This provides a smooth transition from augmented and mixed reality modes, it is convenient to use in the street or when changing light. If necessary, there is a switch for this function to change the transparency of the lenses manually. Thus, Bloom is very comfortable for the eyes.</span>
