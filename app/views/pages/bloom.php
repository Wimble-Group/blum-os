                            <span>Head tracking helps the system build the world around you and understand which vector you're focused on. The objects are pinpointed with SLAM technology. Head-tracking helps you determine the coordinates of the points so that the environment of the glasses is smooth and comfortable and you are more immersed in the process.</span>

This feature makes it easier for you to select, move and interact with objects just by looking at them, making you feel like a hero in a super-suit. The selection is done in the same way as with head tracking.</span>

                            <span>You get an incredible sense of presence. Imagine spinning a levitating 3D rocket engine model in front of you with your own hands over your desk, or wherever your eye is pointing.</span>

Bloom OS remembers every bit of the outside world. You can create a map of your apartment and make one of the walls a virtual desktop. The system will remember where you've pinned your objects, so you can have them there even after waking the device from sleep mode.</span>

One of the key features of the 2D mode is the ability to use the virtual keyboard. You have access to the text input in any application.
